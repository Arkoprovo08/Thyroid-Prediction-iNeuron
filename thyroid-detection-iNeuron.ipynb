        "\n",
        "Ensemble Learning: Random Forest is an ensemble learning algorithm that combines multiple decision trees. By aggregating the predictions of these trees, Random Forest can provide more accurate and robust predictions compared to a single decision tree.\n",

        "Flexibility: Random Forest provides flexibility in selecting hyperparameters, such as the number of trees (n_estimators), splitting criterion (criterion), maximum tree depth (max_depth), and maximum number of features to consider (max_features). This flexibility allows for fine-tuning the model to discover the best combination of hyperparameters.\n",
        "\n",
        "Overfitting Reduction: Random Forest is less susceptible to overfitting than individual decision trees. It achieves this by randomly selecting subsets of features and data during training, resulting in a more generalized model that performs well on unseen data.\n",
        "\n",
        "Feature Importance: Random Forest provides a measure of feature importance, which indicates the relevance of each feature in making predictions. This information can be valuable for feature selection and gaining insights into the underlying patterns in the dataset.\n",
        "\n",
