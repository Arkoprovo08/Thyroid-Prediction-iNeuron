# Thyroid Prediction Web App

This repository contains the code for a web application that predicts whether a person has a thyroid disorder based on certain input features. The web app is built using Streamlit, a popular Python library for building interactive web applications.

## Application Overview

The Thyroid Prediction web app provides a user-friendly interface for users to input various medical features and receive a prediction about whether they have a thyroid disorder. The prediction is based on a machine learning model trained on a dataset of thyroid-related medical data.

## Prerequisites
